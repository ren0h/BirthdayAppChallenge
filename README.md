# BirthdayAppChallenge
How to install and run the project:
To install and run the project, the user needs to have:
- Mac computer
- XCode IDE
inside of the folder BirthdayAppChallenge/BirthdayAppChallenge will be a file with format .xcodeproj, open that and press CMD+K then CMD+R or the play button on the upper left side of XCode

Reasoning behind your technical choices:
Since it was a fairly easy application my technical choises have been quite simple
i decided to not get any external dependency simply because it wasnt needed, if the application had multiple features and calls that needed a proper system, that would have needed a better networking control.

Describe any trade-offs you needed to make and your reasoning:
unfortunately the figma file wasnt working and today is easter monday so i thought i wouldnt be able to reach anyone, i had to "eye" all the proportions 
and i wasnt also able  to add tests because i reached the 3 hours

Point out anything you might do differently if you had more time:
definetely add tests
